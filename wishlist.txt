Here's the things I want to do with this project:
  Incorporate into a webapp (JAX-RS API)
    Users could:
      Follow the stack trace of a piet program
      Give input that would turn into a piet program
        Users could constantly regenerate different random programs that would output that input
        get a database involved
        tbh npiet already has a pretty decent site for all this
          it isn't pretty but it does the job I was intending
          https://www.bertnase.de/npiet/
  Allow any photo type, jpg, etc, not just .ppm/.png  
    Better ppm reader (we only allow ascii ppm right now)
  Dockerize
  Use gradle well
  Unit tests (in more substantial capacity)
  Read files with comments in them plz
  Better logging
  Better arguments (verbose, max steps)
