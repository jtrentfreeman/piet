# Piet
A Piet interpreter written in Java.
The Piet specification was written by David Morgan-Mar, and can be found at

Just a fun program I've been working on here and there occassionally.

All code is my own.

This program requires:
    - Java 11
    - Gradle 7.2

To run:

    ./gradlew run --args="<pathToPietFile>"

This program includes several example files in PPM and PNG format.
I did not write any of these example files, so their validity
may be subject to your judgement.

The program is known to be incomplete and buggy (especially when it comes to white-spaces).
I would recommend using a combination of these Piet interpreters to check accuracy of a particular Piet program.
